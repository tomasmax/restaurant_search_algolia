This is the solution to the hiring assignment for the Solutions team at Algolia.

I used npm, gulp, bootstrap and instantsearch.js by Algolia to develop a restaurant search demo.

## Local Setup
Having npm installed, type in your terminal:
1. `npm install`
2. `gulp sass`
3. `gulp`

## Access to dev or prod deploy

2. Visit http://www.tomasmadariaga.com/restaurant_search_algolia/ on your browser to see production deployment
